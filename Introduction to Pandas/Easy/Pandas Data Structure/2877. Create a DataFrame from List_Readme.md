Write a solution to create a DataFrame from a 2D list called student_data. This 2D list contains the IDs and ages of some students.

The DataFrame should have two columns, student_id and age, and be in the same order as the original 2D list.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input:
student_data:
[
  [1, 15],
  [2, 11],
  [3, 11],
  [4, 20]
]
Output:
+------------+-----+
| student_id | age |
+------------+-----+
| 1          | 15  |
| 2          | 11  |
| 3          | 11  |
| 4          | 20  |
+------------+-----+
Explanation:
A DataFrame was created on top of student_data, with two columns named student_id and age.


```py
import pandas as pd

def createDataframe(student_data: List[List[int]]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    column_names = ["student_id", "age"]
    result_dataframe = pd.DataFrame(student_data, columns = column_names)
    return result_dataframe
```

My Explanation:
1. Create a list called 'column_names' to store the dataframe's column name, which will be passed as an argument while creating a new dataframe and printing the df.
2. Created a dataframe called 'result_dataframe' and gave student_data (2D list) and column_name list as an arguments
3. Returned the new dataframe created in the above step to the function
