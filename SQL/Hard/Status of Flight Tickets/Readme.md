| capacity    | int  |
+-------------+------+

- `flight_id` column contains distinct values.
- Each row of this table contains flight id and capacity.

### Passengers

+--------------+----------+
| Column Name  | Type     |
+--------------+----------+
| passenger_id | int      |
| flight_id    | int      |
| booking_time | datetime |
+--------------+----------+

- `passenger_id` column contains distinct values.
- `booking_time` column contains distinct values.
- Each row of this table contains passenger id, booking time, and their flight id.

## Problem Statement

Passengers book tickets for flights in advance. If a passenger books a ticket for a flight and there are still empty seats available on the flight, the passenger's ticket will be confirmed. However, the passenger will be on a waitlist if the flight is already at full capacity.

Write a solution to determine the current status of flight tickets for each passenger.

Return the result table ordered by `passenger_id` in ascending order.

### Explanation

- Flight 1 has a capacity of 2 passengers. Passenger 101 and Passenger 103 were the first to book tickets, securing the available seats. Therefore, their bookings are confirmed. However, Passenger 102 was the third person to book a ticket for this flight, which means there are no more available seats. Passenger 102 is now placed on the waitlist.
- Flight 2 has a capacity of 2 passengers, and it has exactly two passengers who booked tickets, Passenger 104 and Passenger 105. Since the number of passengers who booked tickets matches the available seats, both bookings are confirmed.
- Flight 3 has a capacity of 1 passenger. Passenger 107 booked earlier and secured the only available seat, confirming their booking. Passenger 106, who booked after Passenger 107, is on the waitlist.

        else "Waitlist"
    end as Status
