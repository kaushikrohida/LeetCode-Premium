# Find Cities in Each State II

## Problem Description

Table: cities

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| state       | varchar |
| city        | varchar |

(state, city) is the combination of columns with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the state name and the city name within that state.

Write a solution to find all the cities in each state and analyze them based on the following requirements:

1. Combine all cities into a comma-separated string for each state.
2. Only include states that have at least 3 cities.
3. Only include states where at least one city starts with the same letter as the state name.
4. Return the result table ordered by the count of matching-letter cities in descending order and then by state name in ascending order.

## Example

### Input:

cities table:

| state        | city          |
|--------------|---------------|
| New York     | New York City |
| New York     | Newark        |
| New York     | Buffalo       |
| New York     | Rochester     |
| California   | San Francisco |
| California   | Sacramento    |
| California   | San Diego     |
| California   | Los Angeles   |
| Texas        | Tyler         |
| Texas        | Temple        |
| Texas        | Taylor        |
| Texas        | Dallas        |
| Pennsylvania | Philadelphia  |
| Pennsylvania | Pittsburgh    |
| Pennsylvania | Pottstown     |

### Output:

| state       | cities                                    | matching_letter_count |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Pennsylvania| Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Pottstown       | 3                      |
| Texas       | Dallas, Taylor, Temple, Tyler             | 3                      |
| New York    | Buffalo, Newark, New York City, Rochester | 2                      |

### Explanation:

- Pennsylvania:
  - Has 3 cities (meets minimum requirement)
  - All 3 cities start with 'P' (same as state)
  - matching_letter_count = 3
- Texas:
  - Has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)
  - 3 cities (Taylor, Temple, Tyler) start with 'T' (same as state)
  - matching_letter_count = 3
- New York:
  - Has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)
  - 2 cities (Newark, New York City) start with 'N' (same as state)
  - matching_letter_count = 2
- California is not included in the output because:
  - Although it has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)
  - No cities start with 'C' (doesn't meet the matching letter requirement)

Note:
- Results are ordered by matching_letter_count in descending order
- When matching_letter_count is the same (Texas and Pennsylvania both have 3), they are ordered by state name alphabetically
- Cities in each row are ordered alphabetically

## Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    c.state,
    GROUP_CONCAT(c.city ORDER BY c.city SEPARATOR ', ') AS cities,
    ce.true_n AS matching_letter_count
FROM cities c
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT
        state,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN LEFT(state, 1) = LEFT(city, 1) THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS true_n,
        COUNT(*) - COUNT(CASE WHEN LEFT(state, 1) = LEFT(city, 1) THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS false_n
    FROM cities
    GROUP BY state
) ce
    ON c.state = ce.state
WHERE
    c.state IN (SELECT state FROM cities GROUP BY state HAVING COUNT(city) >= 3)
    AND true_n >= 1
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC, 1
```

This solution uses a combination of subqueries, joins, and aggregation functions to meet all the requirements of the problem. It first calculates the count of matching-letter cities for each state, then filters and orders the results according to the specified criteria.
